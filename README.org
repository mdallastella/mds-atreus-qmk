* What's this?

I own a [[https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus][Keyboardio Atreus]] but switched to QMK from Kaleidoscope to
further customize my experience.

* How it works

I'm using [[https://book.babashka.org/][Babashka]] as task runner, and to build and flash my keymap I
just type:

#+begin_src shell
  bb flash
#+end_src

This command will:
- Update the QMK repository with the latest features
- Copy my keymap (~mds~ directory) in the right place
- Build the firmware and ask to flash it

On the Atreus, to enter in bootloader mode, you need to disconnect the
keyboard and reconnect it holding the ~ESC~ key.
